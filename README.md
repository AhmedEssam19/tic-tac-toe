## Understanding

There are two main files in this project: `runner.py` and `tictactoe.py`. `tictactoe.py` contains all of the logic for playing the game, and for making optimal moves. `runner.py` contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game. You should be able to run `python3 runner.py` to play against our AI!

 * GUI made by `pygame` module.
